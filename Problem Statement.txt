## Problem Statement

Todo Manager is an application which can Manage our Tasks and keep track of our Tasks. In the course of this week we will be creating a Todo manager.

 

## User Stories

As a user I should be able to login and system should validate the credentials
As a user I should be able to add the task into a list
As a user I should be able to update the task in the list
As a user I should be able to delete the task in the list
As a user I should be able to search a task from a list
As a user I should be able to see all my tasks
As a suer I should be able to see all the completed or incomplete tasks based on the requirement
## Instructions:-

Please create a task pojo.
The task object should have
TaskId(number auto generated)
TaskTitle(String entered by the user)
TaskText( String entered by the user)
assignedTo(String entered by the user â€“ store email of the user)
taskCompleted : boolean(initial value will be false)
Create a class User that should have following attributes
Username
Email
password
Please use list to store the tasks and user objects.
All the CRUD operations should happen in a dao class. Main should contain only menu.
The application can be exited only if user enters 0 to exit. Else user should see the menu again and again.
Enter few dummy credentials for user and test the application for login and tasks for every user.
Enhance the same application with database. Create user and tasks table and fetch data from database.
